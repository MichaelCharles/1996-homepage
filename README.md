# 1996 Homepage

[See this page live on GitHub pages.](https://mcaubrey.github.io/1996-homepage)

I threw this together as a little April Fool's joke on April 1, 2016. I'm currently working my way through FreeCodeCamp's curriculum, while also using some outside resources such as codecademy.com or TeamTreehouse. I decided to make my porfolio, but like it was 1996, which means no stylsheets, a couple of "Under Construction" gifs, and autoplaying background music.
